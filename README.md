# AWS security group visualizer

Create a Dot graph of AWS security groups (rectangular nodes), their inbound
rules (edges), plus allowed CIDR blocks (oval nodes).

Example usage:

```
./aws_sg_vizualizer.py -o security-groups.dot
neato -n -Tsvg -o security-groups.svg security-groups.dot
```

You'll need AWS credentials [anywhere Boto can find them][boto-creds]

## Requirements

- [Python 3][py]
- [Boto 3][boto3]
- [Graphviz Python module][py-graphviz]
- [Graphviz][graphviz] â€” To render the Dot file

## Installation

Using Virtualenv is recommended.

Make sure pip is for Python 3. (Indicated at the end of the version.)

```
pip --version
```

Manually:

```
pip install boto3 graphviz
```

Or, to install tested versions of dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Shortcomings

- Rules pointing outside the AWS account are ignored.
- Egress rules are ignored.
- The final diagram is at the mercy of the whims of Graphviz. More complex
  diagrams and small changes in Graphviz version are likely to mess things up.
